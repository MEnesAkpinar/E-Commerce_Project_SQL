E-Commerce Data and Customer Retention Analysis with SQL


An E-Commerce organization demands some analysis of sales and delivery processes. Thus, the organization hopes to be able to predict more easily the opportunities and threats for the future.

I am asked to make the following analyzes for this scenario by following the instructions given.

Introduction

- I could benefit from the ERD diagram given during work.
- I have to create a database and import it into the given CSV files.
- During the import process, I need to adjust the date columns. I need to carefully observe the data types and how they should be. In our database, a star model will be created with one fact table and four dimension tables.
- The data are not very clean and fully normalized. However, they don't prevent from performing the given tasks. In some cases, I may need to use the string, window, system, or date functions.
- There may be situations where I need to update the tables.
- I need to manually verify the accuracy of my analysis.
